üé∂ Music Store Data Analysis using SQL

Welcome to my SQL project where I explore a digital music store database to uncover key business insights. This repository contains everything you need to follow along and understand how raw data can drive decisions in a music retail environment.

Repository Contents

Project Questions PDF
A PDF file listing all the questions I set out to answer, from simple look-ups to advanced customer-spending analyses.

Database Setup Scripts
Plain-text files showing how to create each table and load sample data into PostgreSQL.

Solution Queries
A single SQL file with three sections:

Easy Level ‚Äì basic SELECTs, GROUP BY and ORDER BY

Moderate Level ‚Äì JOINs across multiple tables and filtering

Advanced Level ‚Äì Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and recursive queries

Raw Data Files
CSV files for every table (customers, invoices, tracks, artists, genres, etc.) so you can inspect the underlying data directly.

Schema Diagrams
Visual ER diagrams showing how tables relate to one another, making it easy to see the structure of the music store database.

Presentation Slide Deck
A PowerPoint file that walks through the project goals, the questions answered, the SQL techniques used, and key findings with charts and tables.

What You Will Learn

How to write clear, reusable SQL queries that answer specific business questions.

How to join tables like customers, invoices, tracks and genres to pull meaningful insights.

How to use CTEs and window functions to tackle more complex reporting tasks.

How database design impacts your queries, by following the visual schema diagrams.

How to present your results in a slide deck with charts, screenshots, and take-aways.

Getting Started

Review the Schema Diagrams to understand the database structure.

Load the CSV files into your PostgreSQL instance or any SQL engine of your choice.

Open the solution SQL file and work through each section:

Start with the easy queries to get acquainted with the tables.

Move on to moderate queries to see how joins and filters combine data.

Dive into advanced queries to explore CTEs, ranking, and recursive logic.

Compare your results with the screenshots in the ‚ÄúOutputs‚Äù folder.

Use the slide deck to see how each question was posed, solved, and what business decisions you might make from the answers.
